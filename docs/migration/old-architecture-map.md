# Old Architecture Map

`old-architecture/` is source material only. New work lands in owner roots.

## Owner Destinations

| Old source | Destination owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `old-architecture/source/core/log.*` | `octaryn-shared/Source/Diagnostics/NativeLogging/` | Ported as `octaryn_native_logging`; focused shared native support, not module API. The old files stay in place until old-architecture targets that still include `core/log.h` are retired or ported. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/crash_diagnostics.*` | `octaryn-shared/Source/Diagnostics/NativeCrashDiagnostics/` | Focused native diagnostics support after logging; rename old crash marker text away from `octaryn-engine-*` during the port. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/memory_mimalloc.*` | `octaryn-shared/Source/Memory/NativeMemory/` | Focused native memory support; SDL coupling removed so consumers depend on a support target, not allocator internals. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/profile.h` | `octaryn-shared/Source/Diagnostics/NativeProfiling/` plus owner-specific scopes | Ported timing/Tracy hooks as `octaryn_native_profiling`; owner-specific profiling policy still moves with each owner consumer. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/check.h` | owner-local assertion wrappers under the owner that needs them, otherwise removal | SDL-specific checks must not become shared API. Client assertions land under `octaryn-client/Source/Diagnostics/ClientAssertions/`; server assertions land under `octaryn-server/Source/Diagnostics/ServerAssertions/`; tool assertions land under the exact tool folder. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/env.h` | owner-local platform configuration readers under the owner that needs them | Client environment access lands under `octaryn-client/Source/Platform/ClientEnvironment/`; server environment access lands under `octaryn-server/Source/Platform/ServerEnvironment/`; tool environment access lands under the exact tool folder. Modules never receive environment access. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/asset_paths.*` | `octaryn-client/Source/Native/AssetPaths/` | Uses executable-relative asset layout through SDL3 when target-compatible, so it is client packaging/presentation support. Old files stay until render/shader old-architecture consumers are ported. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/render_distance.h` | `octaryn-client/Source/Native/Settings/RenderDistance/` plus shared value contract only if needed | Render distance is a client presentation setting unless a later server contract needs a pure value type. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/camera/matrix.cpp`, `internal.h` matrix declarations | `octaryn-client/Source/Native/Rendering/Camera/` | Ported as `octaryn_client_camera_matrix`; full mutable camera/player/world-facing behavior waits for the main client presentation port. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/camera/camera.*` | `octaryn-client/Source/Native/Presentation/Camera/` during main client port | Camera state, FOV, zoom, movement, frustum visibility, and viewport behavior feed player, world presentation, and rendering; split only when those consumers move. |
| `old-architecture/source/app/` | `octaryn-client/Source/` | Window, input, local frame loop, overlays, and managed host edge. |
| `old-architecture/source/render/` | `octaryn-client/Source/Rendering/` | GPU upload, render resources, pipelines, scene presentation, UI rendering. |
| `old-architecture/source/shaders/` | `octaryn-client/Shaders/` plus shader tooling | Runtime shader sources are client-owned assets. |
| `old-architecture/source/tools/shader_tool_main.cpp` | `tools/Source/ShaderCompiler/` | Root shader tooling; generated shader assets are consumed by client-owned shader pipelines. Tool dependency aliases and metadata are staged first; executable port waits for direct shader-output validation. |
| `old-architecture/source/render/shader/asset_metadata.hpp` | `tools/Source/ShaderCompiler/ShaderAssetMetadata.hpp` | Ported as a tool-local metadata schema so root shader tools do not include old render-owned headers. |
| `old-architecture/source/world/edit/` | `octaryn-server/Source/World/` and shared command contracts | Server owns authoritative edit validation and execution. |
| `old-architecture/source/world/runtime/` | split between client presentation and server world authority | Query/render descriptor pieces are not shared implementation. |
| `old-architecture/source/world/chunks/` | split between server chunk authority and client mesh presentation | Storage, streaming, meshing, and upload must be separated. |
| `old-architecture/source/world/generation/` | `octaryn-server/Source/World/Generation/` plus basegame content rules | Execution is server-owned; high-level rules/content are basegame. |
| `old-architecture/source/world/lighting/` | `octaryn-server/Source/World/Lighting/` plus client presentation copies only if needed | Lighting propagation is not basegame content. Keep runtime chunk/block internals server-owned until a clean presentation contract exists. |
| `old-architecture/source/runtime/jobs/runtime_worker_policy.*` | `octaryn-shared/Source/Libraries/NativeJobs/` | Ported as worker policy inside `octaryn_native_jobs`; minimum worker count is two to match the host scheduling contract. |
| `old-architecture/source/runtime/jobs/runtime_worker_pool.*` and `old-architecture/source/world/jobs/` | focused scheduler/job support under client/server owners plus `octaryn_native_jobs` when intentionally ported | New target is one main thread, one coordinator thread, and a scalable worker pool with at least two workers. Do not port old job code as a generic runtime root. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/persistence/settings.cpp`, `settings_limits.h`, settings fields in `scalar_types.h` and `serialization.cpp` | `octaryn-client/Source/Settings/ClientSettings/` plus server host config for worldgen workers | Display, window, render distance, clouds, POM/PBR, and UI-facing settings are client presentation. Split `worldgen_threads` into server/host worker configuration instead of carrying one old app blob. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/persistence/lighting_tuning.cpp` and lighting tuning fields in `scalar_types.h` and `serialization.cpp` | `octaryn-client/Source/Rendering/Lighting/Tuning/` | These values drive render/UI shader tuning, not server world-light authority. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/persistence/player.cpp` and player fields in `world_types.h` | `octaryn-server/Source/Persistence/Players/` plus client prediction snapshots if needed | Server owns authoritative player save/load. Client copies must be presentation/prediction only. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/persistence/world_time_store.cpp` | `octaryn-server/Source/Persistence/WorldTime/` | Server owns persisted authoritative time state. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/persistence/chunk_files.cpp`, `cache.*`, `codec.cpp`, chunk fields in `world_snapshot.cpp` and `world_types.h` | `octaryn-server/Source/Persistence/Chunks/` | Chunk override storage, compression, cache loading, and save file ownership stay server-side. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/persistence/world.cpp`, `world_save.cpp`, `io.cpp`, `paths.cpp`, `state.h` | split between `octaryn-server/Source/Persistence/WorldSave/` and owner-specific import/export adapters | World save/export currently mixes client settings, lighting tuning, world time, players, and chunks. Split before moving behavior; do not place the whole blob under shared. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/persistence/json_file_io.h` | owner-specific persistence/tool helpers, not shared API | Keep file I/O in server or tools. Modules must receive bounded host data handles instead of arbitrary paths. |
| `old-architecture/source/core/world_time/` | `octaryn-server/Source/World/Time/` plus shared snapshots/contracts if needed | Server owns authoritative time progression; basegame may define high-level rules through API only. |
| `old-architecture/source/physics/` | `octaryn-server/Source/Physics/` plus client prediction copies | Server authority first. |
| `old-architecture/source/api/` | replaced by `octaryn-shared/` contracts and host-specific adapters | Do not recreate `Octaryn.Engine.Api`. |

## Removal Rules

- Do not move files into generic `engine/`, `runtime/`, `common`, or catch-all support folders.
- Do not port old job/threading helpers into module code. Thread creation and worker-pool ownership belong to host scheduler support only.
- If a file mixes client/server/basegame responsibilities, split it before porting behavior.
- Old target names such as `octaryn_engine_runtime` remain only under `old-architecture/` until that build is retired.
